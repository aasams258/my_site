  <h1>Los Angeles Health Scores Analysis</h1>

  <p> In this project I combine <b>Los Angeles County's Department of Public Health</b> restaurant inspections dataset
      with <b>Yelp's</b> page listing. I aim to see if there are any correlations between the health score and quality
      of a restaurant in terms of reviews and price.</p>
  <h4> The Data </h4>
  <p> The Public Health Dataset has inspections for over 44,000 places that serve food in LA County: an area of 10 million people.
      The first challenge was to process this data. Yelp's API only allows 5,000 calls per day, and it takes two queries to get the full restaurant details. 
      For the sake of time, I reduced the size of the dataset by focusing on independently owned local restaurants. </p>
  
  <p> I filtered out supermarkets [Von's, Whole Foods, Smart & Final] and Restaurant Chains [KFC, Subway, Sizzler]. 
      Hopefully this makes the data more interesting. I assume franchises would have stringent
      policies to ensure high scores and protect brand image. This assumption can be investigated at a later date.
  </p>
  <p>The final dataset contains approxmitely 16,000 restaurants across all zip codes in LA county.</p>

  <h2> Health Scores and Grades </h2>

  <p> The Health Grade distribution shows that A grades are the majority, with B taking about 1/5th of the share,
      and C's being rare at 2%. </p>

  <p> A facility starts with a score of 100 points, and for each code violation loses points.</p>
  <p> For instance if a facility does not change the lining in a bread basket between customers, that is a MINOR infraction worth 2 points</p>
  <p> If a facility serves ground beef with over 30% fat content, that is a MAJOR infraction worth 4 points.</p>
  <p>A score of: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>90 to 100 receives an A</li>
    <li>80 to 89 receives an B</li>
    <li>70 to 79 receives an C</li>
    <li>0 to 69 does not get a letter, but a card displaying the score instead.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> A restaurant scoring under 70 twice within 12 months are subject to closure, and any major infractions may require closure regardless of score.</p>

  <p> The score distribution looks tri-modal, with peaks occuring around 97, 86, and 76. </p>
  <p> The boundaries between grades look abnormal. Specifically look at the difference between 90-89 and 80-79.
      It seems like inspectors are using their discretion to push boarderline cases to the next highest grade.</p>

  <p> Note to self: What explains the tri-modality? Maybe verify with a Gaussian mixture or Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test? </p>

  <p> Also values under 70 are rare, there is only one occurance (at 65). This is most likely due to restaurants requesting a re-inspection if they did poorly.</p>
  
  <h4> Health Scores as related to...</h4>

  <p> Do health scores correlate to stronger yelp reviews?</p>

  <p> Investigating further, it seems higher rated restaurants have more 4 star reviews.</p>
