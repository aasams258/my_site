<h1> Projects </h1>
<p> These are some public projects I have recently worked on, I choose them to explore new tech and frameworks I am interested in.</p>

<h2> Los Angeles Health Scores </h2>
<p> In the <a href="{{ url_for('health_scores') }}"> Health Score Project</a>, I used the Yelp API with Asynchronous calls to scrape restaurant data, which was then stored in an SQL database for analytics. 
    The main difficulty was dealing with Yelp's rate limiting and low API call allowance.</p>

<h2> Interactive MNIST Classifier</h2>
<p> In the  <a href="{{ url_for('digits') }}"> MNIST project</a>, I wanted to use ML Engine, Services, and Tensorflow. I got to learn Estimators, which greatly improve the readability and speed of writing TF.
    While I did not invent the MNIST model, I had to modify it in order to make it usable for the web and ML Engine. </p>

<h2> Flask Site </h2>
<p> This is a Python Flask site hosted on Google Cloud App Engine. I am using Bootstrap for the frontend. 
   Flask is awesome, but working with HTML and CSS is a pure pain. </p>

<h2> What's Next? </h2>
<p> I want to create a Flask API to do something basic and migrate the site to use Kubernetes.</p>

<h2> Source Code</h2>
<p> All code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/aasams258"> Github </a>. </p>
